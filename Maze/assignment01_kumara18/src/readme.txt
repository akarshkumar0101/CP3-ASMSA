Only MazeSolvingMain.java and MazeMain.java can be run directly.

To run MazeSolvingMain run it with an argument that says what image to use as a maze.
For example running "java MazeSolvingMain my_maze.png" will result in the program telling
you the time it took to solve the maze and it will generate my_maze_solved.png 
to illustrate the path it took to solve it.

MazeMain.java can be run without arguments and will produce fibonacci height and width
mazes from i=2 to infinity. The program must be stopped manually when running times take too long.
